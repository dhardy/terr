Procedural terrain generation algorithms.

![Example](/fractal.png?raw=true)

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Examples:

-   `flat`: just flat
-   `noise`: uncorrelated noise
-   `fractal-md`: fractal generation using the midpoint displacement algorithm
-   `fractal-ds`: fractal generation using the diamond-square algorithm

These are all very simple algorithms. Hopefully this library will accumulate
more, and better, techniques, along with mesh optimisation and texturing
support.
